<h1>Prediction of Weather using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques</h1>

<p>Weather conditions in Colombo, Sri Lanka have been predicted using deep learning models such as:</p>
<li>Random Forest Model</li>
<li>Artificial Neural Network(ANN)</li>
<li>Recurrent Neural Network</li>
</b>
<p>Through this I learnt about the architecture and the different techniques which could be used to come up with an efficient model.</p>
